# InfluenceDiagrams


When building a diagram, make sure to follow this steps in order.

1. INSTANTIATING NODES
Drag and drop all desired nodes from toolbox to canvas.
Double-click on each node to give it a name.

2. SETTING NODE DEFINITIONS
Add definitions to each respective node, excluding "Value nodes".
These are decisions or possible outcomes. When done adding definitions to a node, press a "Checkmark" button to save.

3. BUILDING NODE RELATIONS
When you're done with names and definitions, you're set to begin with influences.
To create a relation/influence(arrow between 2 nodes), hover over an achor (top, bottom, left, right) and drag-drop it to another anchor.
Make sure to DragDrop and not click (not handled yet, might cause errors).

4. SETTING PROBABILITIES
When you're done with relations, you can start setting event outcome probabilities.
Enter a probability between 0 and 1 to each respective outcome. Make sure, that all complementary events have probabilities that add up to 1 and have a decimal separator your computer uses.
When done setting probabilites, click "Save probabilities" button.

5. SETTING VALUE OUTCOMES
Similarly to setting probabilities, you have to set value outcomes aswell. Click "Save outcomes" when done.

6. START EVALUATING
Now you're set to go. If you've done everything so far, you can press "Start Evaluating" button on the top of the window.
You are encouraged to save a diagram before you unbundle any node, sou you have a starting point.

You can unbundle event and decision nodes. Right-click a node to try unbundling it.
Turning relations is done in a similar procedure.
