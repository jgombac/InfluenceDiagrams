# InfluenceDiagrams


When building a diagram, make sure to follow this steps in order.<br />

1. INSTANTIATING NODES <br />
Drag and drop all desired nodes from toolbox to canvas.<br />
Double-click on each node to give it a name.<br />

2. SETTING NODE DEFINITIONS <br />
Add definitions to each respective node, excluding "Value nodes".<br />
These are decisions or possible outcomes. When done adding definitions to a node, press a "Checkmark" button to save.<br />

3. BUILDING NODE RELATIONS<br />
When you're done with names and definitions, you're set to begin with influences.<br />
To create a relation/influence(arrow between 2 nodes), hover over an achor (top, bottom, left, right) and drag-drop it to another anchor.


4. SETTING PROBABILITIES<br />
When you're done with relations, you can start setting event outcome probabilities.<br />
Enter a probability between 0 and 1 to each respective outcome. Make sure, that all complementary events have probabilities that add up to 1 and have a decimal separator your computer uses.<br />
When done setting probabilites, click "Save probabilities" button.<br />

5. SETTING VALUE OUTCOMES<br />
Similarly to setting probabilities, you have to set value outcomes aswell. Click "Save outcomes" when done.<br />

6. START EVALUATING<br />
Now you're set to go. If you've done everything so far, you can press "Start Evaluating" button on the top of the window.<br />
You are encouraged to save a diagram before you unbundle any node, sou you have a starting point.<br />
<br />
You can unbundle event and decision nodes. Right-click a node to try unbundling it.<br />
Turning relations is done in a similar procedure.<br />
